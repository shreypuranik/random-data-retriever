# Random Data Retriever
As much as I enjoy watching random prize draws run on command line, I fancied making a browser based UI. So this project came about. It runs using PHP, with a bit of JavaScript.

# How to set up
Clone this code repository to your server by running git clone https://github.com/shreypuranik/random-data-retriever.git or by downloading the ZIP file from Github

Place your raw data file (separated by line) in the sample datafile.txt file within the datastore directory

# How to use

Visit the app in your browser, and press the button to retrieve a random line of data

# Please get in touch!

Suggestions, tweaks, and code contributions are always welcome.

This was coded one Saturday evening. And yes, I was listening to Aerosmith at the time ;) (See the data file for the terrible joke that this relates to!)
